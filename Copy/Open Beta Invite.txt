Sappy Secrets – An AR Tree-Spy Action-Adventure by Me

Content:
Do you like trees, spies, games, or moving around outside?

If yes, I would like to introduce Sappy Secrets, an augmented reality tree-spy action-adventure developed by me for you. Sappy Secrets is an arboreous espionage game played with your earbuds while walking or running around your neighborhood. As Agent Almond, a proud tree of the Redwood Republic, you will root out the truth in a forest of lies.

I need people to test the game as it is made. In exchange, I'll make the game for you and you'll get it for free!
